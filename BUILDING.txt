The detailed test instructions, publication and homepage changes are to be integrated.

0. Ensure that your ~/.m2/settings.xml authorizes you to push 
   packages into the Maven repository at
   http://repository.membrane-soa.org . 

1. Run all tests locally ("mvn integration-test" in both
   membrane-esb and membrane-monitor).
   
2. Increment Version, for example from 3.3.5-SNAPSHOT to 3.3.5:

   a. In all pom.xml files: This affects either //project/version
      or //project/parent/version (which ever exists).
   
   b. In all membrane-monitor/*/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF files,
      change "Bundle-Version". Note that the "-SNAPSHOT" suffix of
      the Maven version translates into the suffix ".qualifier"
      here.

3. Run "mvn deploy -DskipTests" first in \membrane-esb\, then in
   \membrane-monitor\ . (Note that this deployment can only
   be done once for non-SNAPSHOT releases.)   

4. Increment Version again (repeat step 2), now for example from
   3.3.5 to 3.3.6-SNAPSHOT.

5. Check in your changes to the pom.xml and MANIFEST.MF files.
